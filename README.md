# TableUnflipper
A discord bot to put your tables back.

# What does it do?
If it detects someone flipping a table (`(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻`) it puts it back (`┬─┬ ノ(¬_¬ノ)`).

# Why?
Why not? (One of my friends ask me to make this)

# Usage
1. Clone the repo, run `npm ci` to install dependencies.
2. Create a file called `.env` and put `DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` in it (replace YOUR_TOKEN_HERE with your token).
3. Run `npm start` to start the bot.
