# TableUnflipper
A discord bot to put your tables back.

# What does it do?
If it detects someone flipping a table (`(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻`) it puts it back (`┬─┬ ノ(¬_¬ノ)`).

# Why?
Why not? (One of my friends ask me to make this)

# Usage
Clone the repo, run `npm ci` to install dependencies and `npm start` to start the bot.
